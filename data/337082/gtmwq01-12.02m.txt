2) Entry verification:

Data are uploaded to a PC from the YSI Model 6600 data sonde and graphs are 
produced using EcoWatch software Version 3.13.  EcoWatch is used to plot the 
data and perform basic statistical analysis (i.e., min, max, mean, std dev).  
Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may result from probe failure.  Notes 
are made of any unusual data, and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  Each 
data file is exported as a comma delimited file (.cdf) using EcoWatch software.  
Two copies of this .cdf file are saved in the .csv format; one file is used to 
archive the raw data, whereas the second file is edited to adjust all records to 
Eastern Standard Time (as needed), to adjust the time as needed to read exactly 
at the top or bottom of the hour (e.g., 00:00:00; true times on sondes were in 
many cases 00:00:40 past the top and bottom of the hour), to remove headers and 
footers, and to delete data at the beginning and end of each record when the 
instruments were out of the water.  These latter data are identified by field 
notes that document the times in and out of the water, together with depth and 
conductivity values near zero.
Using the edited .csv files, monthly data are compiled and processed by various 
macros distributed by the CDMO.  These macros are designed to: 1) check data 
files for missing data points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods (.), 3) convert the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, 
date and numeric variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range 
for the sensors, 5) save the files as Excel worksheets (*.xls) and 6) generate 
single parameter monthly graphs.
Anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete the suspect 
values.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range expected for 
the site, or 2) outside the range of measurements established for the sensors 
(see Table 1).  Data outside the "normal" range of water quality parameters for 
a particular site were investigated for validity based on weather data, field 
observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  Data 
are deleted if the anomalies are attributed to sensor malfunction.  In addition 
to observations of any physical damage (e.g., a torn DO probe membrane), sensor 
malfunctions are detected if the voltage reading of the probe is outside the 
range established for the sensor or the sensor will not calibrate.  After 
corrections are made to the monthly Excel worksheet (*.xls), the edited files 
are exported as tab-delimited files (*.txt) and sent to the CDMO.  Raw data 
(*.csv) files are also sent to the CDMO for archiving.  Laura Herren is 
responsible for these tasks.


3) Research objectives:

The goal of the GTM NERR monitoring initiative is to examine the short term 
variability and long term trends of water quality profiles at spatially and 
hydrographically representative locations within the Reserve.  Two stations 
[Fort Matanzas (FM) and San Sebastian (SS)] are positioned in close proximity 
to the two inlets of the GTM estuarine system, and two [(Pine Island (PI) and 
Pellicer Creek (PC)] are located within regions more influenced by freshwater 
inputs in the northern and southern sections of the Reserve, respectively.  
Profile comparisons can be made among and between stations based on this 
"salinity gradient", but also based on an "urbanization gradient", since the SS 
station is situated in a rather urbanized watershed relative to the other 
sites.


4) Research methods:

In the GTM NERR, YSI 6600 data sondes have been continuously operated (data 
collection interval: 30 minutes) at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring 
stations since December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek 
monitoring stations since February 2002.  At each site the sonde is contained 
within a 10 cm ID diameter PVC pipe mounted vertically on a piling.  A steel pin 
at the bottom end of the pipe holds the sonde at a position within 1 meter from 
the bottom.  To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2 cm diameter 
holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe.  Hole density is 
greatest near the base where the sonde sensors are located.  To avoid heavy 
fouling, sondes were exchanged more frequently during the summer than in cooler 
months (see deployment times in section 6: Data collection period).  Exchanges 
usually took less than 5 minutes, thus no planned downtime occurred.  At the end 
of a sampling period, sondes were returned to the laboratory where post-
deployment readings and reconditioning took place in accordance with the methods 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  After a superficial rinse of 
the sonde in tap water, post deployment readings were recorded for temperature 
and in standards for pH (Fisher 7.00 buffer solution) and conductivity (Exaxol 
50.00 mS/cm standard); a post-deployment turbidity reading in 0.0 NTU standard 
(DI water) was recorded after a more thorough rinse of the turbidity sensor.  
This rinse was done to avoid contamination of the NTU standard.  The results of 
these post-deployment readings were used to evaluate the validity of data (see 
Tables 6-9).  The dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane was replaced and allowed to 
equilibrate for 24 hours before the DO sensor was pre-calibrated in water-
saturated air for the following deployment.


5) Site location and character:
The GTM NERR (North section [NW and SE corners]: 30.1632º N, 81.3447º W 
and 29.9698º N, 81.2488º W; South section: 29.8295º N, 81.3294º W and 29.6017º 
N, 81.1936º W), located in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin, 
includes over 60,000 acres of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, 
estuarine lagoons and offshore seas.  Geographically separated by the greater 
St. Augustine area, the Reserve is associated with the riverine systems of the 
Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River estuary 
to the south.  The Tolomato River Basin is about 18 miles (29 km) in length 
with a drainage area of approximately 53,802 acres; it converges with the 
Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic 
Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.  The headwaters of the Guana River originate 
in the Diego Plains drainage area in Ponte Vedra Beach.  This drainage basin 
encompasses approximately 7,800 acres.  The Guana River runs parallel to the 
Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 7 miles (11.3 km) 
north of the St. Augustine Inlet.  The Matanzas River estuary is approximately 
20 miles (32 km) in length and extends 8 miles (13 km) south of the Matanzas 
Inlet.  The Matanzas River sub-basin has a drainage area of approximately 
103,615 acres and is bounded to the west by the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, which 
separates it from the lower St. Johns River basin.  Both the St. Augustine and 
Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system.  The Matanzas Inlet, 
one of the last "natural" inlets on Florida's east coast, has been unimproved 
and is suitable only for small watercraft.  The natural hydrology of the Guana 
Tolomato Matanzas system has been somewhat altered by water control structures, 
including dikes, inland wells, drainage ditches and a dam across a portion of 
the Guana River.  In addition, the Intracoastal Waterway traverses both the 
Tolomato and Matanzas estuaries.
The climate of northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and 
is characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plain of the Southeastern 
United States.  The average annual rainfall is approximately 52 inches per 
year, with the wet season extending from June through September.  Seasonal 
variation in temperature within the Reserve follows that of rainfall with a 
summer period of high temperatures between June and September and a cooler 
period extending from December through March.  The annual mean air temperature 
within the Reserve is approximately 21ºC.
Station details: The SWMP water quality initiative began within the GTM 
NERR in 2001 at one permanent station in both the northern and the southern 
sections of the Reserve.  The stations were somewhat centrally located to be 
representative of the conditions within that region.  Existing Channel Markers 
in the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) were selected as the preferred 
mounting locations.  The sonde at the Pine Island site is deployed in a PVC 
pipe fixed to Channel Marker 25 (30º 03.051´N; 81º 22.048´W) in the Tolomato 
River.  This site is located within the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve in 
the northern section of the GTM NERR.  Channel Marker 25 is adjacent to Pine 
Island near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from 
silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato 
River Basin.  The sonde at the Fort Matanzas site (in the southern section of 
the GTM NERR) is deployed in a PVC pipe fixed to ICW Channel Marker 75 (29º 
44.222´N; 81º 14.757´W) in the Matanzas River.  This site is located 4 km north 
of the Matanzas Inlet and is near a shoreline on Anastasia Island that is 
undergoing moderate residential development.  Both the Matanzas River and 
Tolomato River sites are situated within Class II Shellfish Harvesting Waters.  
In February 2002, two additional monitoring stations were added to the 
program.  The San Sebastian site is at Channel Marker 1 (29º 52.131´N; 81º 
18.446´W) located at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers, 
approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet.  Sonde deployment is as 
described above.  The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the 
western portion of St. Augustine; it is characterized by both residential and 
commercial development including five marinas.  The Pellicer Creek site (29º 
40.024´N; 81º 15.444´W), located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve, is in 
the southern section of the GTM Reserve.  Pellicer Creek is tidal and bordered 
for much of its length by relatively pristine publically-owned conservation 
lands.  The PVC pipe used to house the sonde is mounted on a concrete-filled 
PVC piling driven into the sediment at the end of a floating dock in Faver 
Dykes State Park.
Based on available data, the average depth (i.e., sonde depth), tidal 
range and salinity range, respectively, for each of the four stations is: (Pine 
Island) 2.8 m, 1.6 m, 6.3-37.6 ppt; (Fort Matanzas) 2.6 m, 1.4 m, 11.2-37.2 
ppt; (San Sebastian) 3.4 m, 1.7 m, 26.3-37.9 ppt; (Pellicer Creek) 1.3 m, 0.6 
m, 0.1-34.9 ppt.  At all sites, the bottom is characterized by a muddy sand 
type habitat.



6) Data collection period:

Data sondes were first deployed on December 21, 2000 at the Pine Island and the 
Fort Matanzas sites, and on February 18, 2002 at the Pellicer Creek and San 
Sebastian Sites.  All stations have been continuously in service since then.  
All monitoring is considered long-term.  Individual sonde deployment and 
retrieval dates and times for 2002 are as follows:

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The GTM NERR has formed partnerships with other agencies and organizations 
actively involved in resource protection in the GTM NERR watershed.  Cooperating 
managers of lands within the NERR include:  1) National Park Service (NPS), 2) 
St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD), 3) Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) Division of Recreation and Parks/Florida Park 
Service (FPS), 4) DEP Aquatic Preserve Program, 5) Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission, and 6) Flagler County.  
The SJRWMD Northern Coastal Basin Program, established in 1995, covers the 
watersheds along the Intracoastal Waterway from Ponce Inlet in Volusia County, 
north through Flagler and St. Johns Counties, to the Guana River marshes at 
Ponte Vedra in southern Duval County. This program was developed in response to 
concerns about the impacts of population growth and development on water quality 
in the Northern Coastal Basin (NCB).  Some of the major research activities 
conducted within the boundaries of the NERR through the NCB program include: 1) 
a fisheries monitoring project in conjunction with United States Geological 
Survey, 2) hydrodynamic modeling of the estuarine systems, and 3) water quality 
monitoring.  Many of the water quality monitoring and assessment activities of 
the NCB program are aimed at pollution source identification and the development 
of pollution load reduction goals.
Other water quality research and monitoring initiatives within the GTM NERR 
include: 
1) studies of nutrient profiles by the laboratory of Dr. Edward Phlips at the 
University of Florida (this work compliments and extends the GTM NERR's SWMP 
nutrient monitoring efforts), and 
2) regular monitoring of fecal coliform levels in shellfish harvesting waters by 
the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
NERR-specific research projects currently in progress include: 1) a CICEET 
funded study by Dr. Jody Harwood at the University of South Florida to develop a 
real-time, fiber-optic biosensor for human pathogens in estuarine waters, 2) a 
NERR-funded graduate research project to decipher the parameters affecting 
reforestation of spoil islands, 3) a NERR-funded graduate research project to 
develop an estuarine planning strategy through an assessment of human use 
patterns together with a delineation of ecological resources, 4) a collaboration 
with the National Weather Service in Jacksonville and University of North 
Florida to test a web-enabled, wireless communication system for real-time data 
acquisition from field instruments, 5) a collaboration with the University of 
South Carolina to monitor the abundance and distribution of non-indigenous crab 
species at selected NERR sites on the east and west coasts of the US, and 6) a 
study to examine the winter recruitment of juvenile bluefish (Pomatomus 
saltatrix) in Northeast Florida.

10) Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions:

File definitions: YSI deployment site/file definition/month/year (e.g., FMWQ0302 
= monthly water quality data from the Fort Matanzas site for March of 2002).  PI 
= Pine Island; SS = San Sebastian; FM = Fort Matanzas; and PC = Pellicer Creek. 


11) Anomalous data:
  	
Note that slight shifts in data are sometimes correlated with sonde exchanges.  
These shifts are most noticeable in pH, specific conductivity, salinity, DO% and 
DO conc, and may be related to sensor drift (e.g., due to fouling) and/or 
calibration differences between sondes.

Depth data at SS shifted up approximately 2.3 m between 7/22 10:30 and 12/12 
13:30 due to interference of fouling organisms attached to the inside of the PVC 
housing.  These fouling organisms prevented the sonde from reaching the bottom 
in all deployments between the above time with the exception of the 11/5 10:30 
to 11/15 11:00 deployment, in which case the sonde was physically pushed down to 
its original position at the bottom of the PVC housing.  
  
Turbidity "outliers" (i.e., values that are negative or greater than 1000 NTU) 
are listed separately in Tables 2 and 3; unless specifically stated in the 
listings below, these data were not deleted from the monthly records.  Negative 
turbidity values occur throughout the year at all four sites. These negative 
values are within range of the sensor (+/- 2 NTU) and, therefore, were not 
removed from the dataset.  Data < -2 NTU may indicate a slight shift due to 
calibration error.
  
DO shifts associated with calibration/performance differences were seen when 
sonde exchanges occurred at the Fort Matanzas site in May, June, and July.

January 1-31, 2002

PI
a) 	Suspect turbidity data between 1/22 19:30:00 and 1/31 23:30:00 possibly 
due to the heavy bioaccumulation and a 10 cm blenny seen upon retrieval.

FM
a)	Dropouts occurred on 1/30 at 09:00:00 and 09:30:00 and 1/31 at 06:30:00, 
09:30:00, 19:30:00, and 22:00:00, reason unknown (low battery voltage?).
b)	DO data were deleted between 1/1 00:00:00 and 1/9 12:00:00.  The DO 
membrane and o-ring were missing when retrieved from the field.  A 10 cm crab 
was also found in the guard upon retrieval.
c)	DO data were deleted between 1/9 12:30:00 and 1/31 23:30:00 due to an out 
of range charge reading during the calibration process.

February 1-28, 2002
PI
a)	Missing data point on 2/8 at 12:00:00 due to sonde exchange.
b)	Suspect turbidity data between 2/1 00:00:00 and 2/8 11:30:00 possibly due 
to the heavy bioaccumulation and a 10 cm blenny seen upon retrieval.  
c)  	Deleted DO data between 2/3 15:00:00 and 2/8 11:30:00 due to high amounts 
of algal growth and bioaccumulation on the sensor.
d)	Strange dip in sp. conductivity and salinity data on 2/21, reason unknown.
e)	The high jump in sp. conductivity on 2/8 12:30:00 may be due to the large 
amount of algal growth on the sensor seen upon retrieval.

SS
Data collection at this site began 2/18 17:00:00.
a)	The sonde was not equipped with a turbidity sensor until 3/16 07:30:00.
b)	Suspect DO data between 2/26 12:00 and 2/28 23:30:00, reason for the 
downward shift unknown.

FM
a)	Dropouts (apparently due to power failures) occurred on 2/1 at 05:00:00, 
05:30:00, 07:30:00, 10:00:00, 12:00:00, 21:00:00, 22:30:00, 23:00:00.  On 2/2 at 
05:00:00, 05:30:00, 07:30:00, 09:30:00, 13:00:00, 20:30:00, 22:30:00, and

and 23:30:00.  On 2/4 at 07:00:00, 07:30:00, and 08:00:00.  The last reading for 
the deployment occurred on 2/4 at 13:30:00.  Sonde exchange occurred 2/8 
14:00:00, therefore no data were recorded between 2/4 14:00:00 and 2/8 13:30:00.
b)	DO data were deleted between 2/1 00:00:00 and 2/4 13:30:00 due to an out 
of range charge reading during the calibration process.

Deleted the first in-water reading 17:00:00 on the 3/14 to 3/22 deployment.
b)	No turbidity data collected between 3/1 00:00:00 and 3/14 17:00:00.  
Waiting for 6136 probe to arrive from YSI.
c)	Suspect turbidity data between 3/22 10:30:00 and 3/31 23:30:00 due to an 
apparent offset created during the calibration process.

April 1-30, 2002
PI
a)	Suspect turbidity data between 4/4 11:00:00 and 4/12 10:00:00 possibly due 
to either heavy bioaccumulation or a stone crab found within the guard upon 
retrieval. 
b)	High number of dropouts between 4/14 and 4/25 probably due to either low 
battery voltage (7.0 upon retrieval) or corroded battery connections.  Dropouts 
occurred on 4/14 between 07:00 and 18:30:00, 20:00:00 and 22:00:00, 4/14 
23:00:00 and 4/15 21:30:00, 4/15 23:30:00 and 4/16 07:30:00, 4/16 08:30:00 and 
21:30:00, 4/16 22:30 and 4/17 04:30:00, then the sonde worked again until 4/25 
11:30:00, and shut down on 4/25 at 20:30:00 and remained off until the end of 
the deployment on 5/23 at 10:00:00.

SS	 
a)	Suspect sp. conductivity and salinity data between 4/10 19:30:00 and 4/14 
16:30:00, possibly due to bioaccumulation or the presence of shrimp in the guard 
upon retrieval.

FM
a)	Deleted sp. conductivity, salinity, DO mg/l, and depth data between 4/22 
15:30:00 and 4/30 23:30:00.  Conductivity cell constant (5.60539) was out of 
range and due to the incorporation of this data into formulas, DO mg/l and depth 
were also deleted.
b)	Suspect DO data between 4/20 10:30 and 4/22 15:00 possibly due to 
bioaccumulation found upon retrieval.

PC
a)	Suspect turbidity data between 4/1 00:00:00 and 4/4 09:30:00 due to an 
apparent offset 
created during the calibration process.

May 1-31, 2002
PI
a) 	No data between 5/1 00:00:00 and 5/23 10:00:00 due to battery failure (7.0 
V upon retrieval).	

SS
a)	Suspect sp. conductivity and salinity data between 5/26 11:00:00 and 5/31 
23:30:00.  The shift may be due to a calibration error. 

FM
a)	Deleted sp. conductivity, salinity, DO mg/l, and depth data between 5/1 
00:00:00 and 5/8 13:00:00.  Conductivity cell constant (5.60539) was out of 
range and due to the incorporation of this data into formulas, DO mg/l and depth 
were also deleted.

PC
a)	Deleted DO data between 5/20 09:00:00 and 5/29 09:00:00.  Two small holes 
were seen in the DO membrane upon retrieval.  

June 1-30, 2002
PI
a)	Suspect salinity data between 6/1 00:00:00 and 6/10 08:30:00, reason 
unclear.

SS
a)	Suspect sp. conductivity and salinity data between 6/1 00:00:00 and 6/8 
07:00:00.  The shift may be due to a calibration error. 
b)	Suspect all parameters between 6/8 07:30:00 and 6/28 13:30:00 due to 
misplaced pre-calibration data.
c)	Unusual salinity data between 6/12 00:00:00 and 6/19 16:30:00.  These 
unusual data fall in the middle of a single deployment and, therefore, may be 
valid.  
d)	Interesting turbidity data between 6/24 08:00:00 and 6/28 13:30:00, 
possibly the result of rainfall.
 
FM
a)	6/3 13:30:00 reading missed due to the sonde exchange process.

PC
a)	Unusually low sp. conductivity and salinity readings from 6/21 on towards 
the end of the month.  These unusual data appear to be valid.  There were heavy 
local rain showers on 6/21.

July 1-31, 2002
PI
The sonde deployed between 6/28 14:30:00 and 7/31 08:30:00 was completely 
covered with fouling organisms/crabs and stuck in the PVC housing.  The old PVC 
tube was replaced with a new housing and data collection began again on 7/31 
10:00:00. 
 
a)	Deleted DO data between 7/4 08:30:00 and 7/31 08:30:00 due to extremely 
heavy bioaccumulation, a missing DO membrane, and small barnacles growing on the 
surface of the sensor (area usually covered by the Teflon membrane) upon 
retrieval.
b)	Suspect sp. conductivity, salinity, pH, and turbidity data between 7/5 
10:00:00 and 7/10 18:30:00 due to extremely heavy bioaccumulation on the sensor 
upon retrieval.
c)	Deleted sp. conductivity, salinity, depth, pH, and turbidity data between 
7/10 19:00 and 7/31 08:30:00 due to extremely heavy bioaccumulation on the 
sensors and a missing turbidity wiper upon retrieval.  Depth data were deleted 
due to the incorporation of sp. conductivity values in the calculation for 
depth. 
d)	No data collected between 7/31 09:00:00 and 7/31 09:30:00 due to the 
exchange of the PVC housing.

SS
a)	Suspect turbidity data between 7/13 20:30:00 and 7/23 13:00:00, possibly 
due to the heavy bioaccumulation and/or 2 large crabs found within the guard 
upon retrieval.
b)	Suspect depth data between 7/23 13:30 and 7/31 23:30:00 (see general 
statement at the beginning of section 11).
c)	Deleted aberrant DO data between 7/29 10:00:00 and 7/31 23:30:00 - 
possibly due to a 13 cm toadfish (Opsanus tau) found within the guard upon 
retrieval and probably a broken DO membrane based on negative readings and a 
high post-cal reading (115% DO).
d)	Suspect sp. conductivity and salinity data between 7/29 13:30:00 and 7/31 
23:30:00 possibly due to the 13 cm toadfish (Opsanus tau) found within the guard 
upon retrieval.

a)	Suspect sp. conductivity and salinity data between 8/8 11:30:00 and 8/13 
11:30:00 possibly due to heavy barnacle bioaccumulation discovered upon 
retrieval.
b)	Suspect turbidity data between 8/9 15:00:00 and 8/13 11:30:00 possibly due 
to the large amount of bioaccumulation (algae and barnacles) found on the sonde 
upon retrieval.
c)	Suspect DO data between 8/9 06:00:00 and 8/13 11:30:00 and 8/19 20:30:00

PI
a)	Suspect turbidity data between 9/22 12:30:00 and 9/27 09:30:00.  Although 
there are no field notes to justify the statement, based on the previous 
deployment and the abundance of settling organisms at this time of the year, the 
drift is probably due to heavy bioaccumulation on the sonde.

SS
The 6136 Turbidity sensor was recalled to YSI for repair of the malfunctioning

9/23 14:00:00 and 11/15 14:30:00.

a)	No turbidity data between 10/1 00:00:00 and 10/31 23:30:00 due to the 
recall mentioned above.		
b)	10/15 10:00:00 missed reading due to the sonde exchange process.

The 6136 Turbidity sensor was recalled to YSI for repair of the malfunctioning 
wiper motor.  Therefore, no turbidity data were recorded at the PC site between 
9/23 14:30:00 and 10/29 17:30:00.
a)	No turbidity data between 10/1 00:00:00 and 10/29 17:30:00 due to the 
recall mentioned above.  
b)	Turbidity data were deleted between 10/29 18:00:00 and 10/31 23:00:00 due 
to "out of range" readings during the calibration process.


November 1-30, 2002
PI
a)	Deleted DO data between 11/22 00:00:00 and 11/26 10:00:00 due to a torn DO 
membrane.	

SS
The 6136 Turbidity sensor was recalled to YSI for repair of the malfunctioning 
wiper motor.  Therefore, no turbidity data were recorded at the SS site between 
9/27 09:30:00 and 11/15 11:00:00.

a)	No turbidity data were collected between 11/1 00:00:00 and 11/15 11:00:00 
due to the recall described above.

b)	Suspect depth data between 11/1 00:00:00 and 11/31 23:30:00 (see general 
statement at the beginning of section 11).   Note that sonde appeared to drop 
down to the original location (~1 m from the bottom) during the 11/5 10:30:00 to 
11/15 11:00:00 deployment.

c) 	All data deleted 11/30 23:00:00 – 23:30:00. The reason for these anomalous 
data are unknown. 

FM
The 6136 Turbidity sensor was recalled to YSI for repair of the malfunctioning 
wiper motor. Therefore, no turbidity data were recorded at the FM site between 
9/23 14:00:00 and 11/15 14:30:00.

a)	No turbidity data were collected between 11/1 00:00:00 and 11/15 14:30:00 
due to the recall described above.

PC
a)	Turbidity data were deleted between 11/1 00:00:00 and 11/13 11:30:00 due 
to "out of range" readings during the calibration process.
b)	Although the DO membrane was torn upon retrieval on 11/13 11:30:00, it is 
suspected that the membrane was punctured during the retrieval process by the 3 
large crayfish found in the guard.  DO data show no evidence of a torn membrane 
while in the field. 

December 1-31, 2002
PI
No data anomalies.

SS
a)	Suspect depth data between 12/1 00:00:00 and 12/12 13:30:00 (see general 
statement at the beginning of section 11).
b)	Suspect pH data between 12/12 14:00:00 and 12/20 12:30:00 possibly due to 
a calibration offset.

FM
a)	Suspect DO data between 12/9 14:00:00 and 12/20 15:00:00 possibly due to 
the deployment of a sonde with a dirty DO membrane (the membrane was not cleaned 
or replaced prior to the deployment).

PC
No data anomalies.

12) Missing data:  

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For details on deleted data, see 
Anomalous Data Section (Section 11).  For more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator.

14) Other remarks/notes:

On 06/30/2021 this dataset was updated to include embedded QAQC flags for 
anomalous/suspect data.  System-wide monitoring data beginning in 2007 were 
processed to allow for QAQC flags and codes to be embedded in the data 
files rather than detailed in the metadata alone (as in the anomalous/suspect, 
deleted, and missing data sections above).  Prior to 2006, rejected data were 
deleted from the dataset so they are unavailable to be used at all, but 
suspect data were only noted in the metadata document.  Suspect data flags 
<1> were embedded retroactively in order to allow suspect data to be easily 
identified and filtered from the dataset if desired for analysis and reporting 
purposes.  No other flags or codes were embedded in the dataset and users 
should still refer to the detailed explanations above for more information.

a)	Calibration of DO was preformed on the day of deployment.
